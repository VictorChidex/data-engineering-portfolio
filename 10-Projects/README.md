Prepare the Data
Download the green taxi trips data for November 2025:
```bash
wget https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/green_tripdata_2025-11.parquet
```
You will also need the dataset with zones:
```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv 
```
Question 3. Counting short trips
For the trips in November 2025 (lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01', exclusive of the upper bound), how many trips had a trip_distance of less than or equal to 1 mile?
- 7,853
- 8,007 - Answer
- 8,254
- 8,421

```bash
SELECT COUNT(*) AS trips_le_1_mile
FROM green_tripdata
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= TIMESTAMP '2025-11-01'
  AND lpep_pickup_datetime <  TIMESTAMP '2025-12-01'
  AND trip_distance <= 1;
```


Question 4. Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with trip_distance less than 100 miles. (1 point)
- 2025-11-14
- 2025-11-20
- 2025-11-23
- 2025-11-25

```bash
SELECT
    DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) AS pickup_day,
    trip_distance
FROM  public.green_taxi_trips_2025_11
WHERE trip_distance < 100
ORDER BY trip_distance DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Question 5. Which was the pickup zone with the largest total_amount (sum of all trips) on November 18th, 2025? (1 point)
- East Harlem North - Answer
- East Harlem South 
- Morningside Heights
- Forest Hills

```bash
SELECT 
	zpu."Zone" AS "pickup_zone",
  CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
	ROUND(SUM(t."total_amount")::numeric, 2) AS total_revenue

FROM
	public.green_taxi_trips_2025_11	AS t 
JOIN 
	public.zones AS zpu
	ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
WHERE
	CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) >= '2025-11-18'
	AND CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) < '2025-11-19'
GROUP BY
	pickup_zone
ORDER By
	total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;

```bash
SELECT 
	zpu."Zone" AS "pickup_zone",
	zdo."Zone" AS "dropoff_zone",
	CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
	ROUND(SUM(t."tip_amount")::numeric, 2) AS tot_tip_Nov_2025_East_Harlem_North

FROM
	public.green_taxi_trips_2025_11	AS t 
JOIN 
	public.zones AS zpu
	ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
JOIN
	public.zones AS zdo
	ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
	
WHERE
	CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) >= '2025-11-01'
	AND CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) <= '2025-11-30'
	AND zpu."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'

GROUP BY
	pickup_zone, dropoff_zone, CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE)

ORDER By
	tot_tip_Nov_2025_East_Harlem_North DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
